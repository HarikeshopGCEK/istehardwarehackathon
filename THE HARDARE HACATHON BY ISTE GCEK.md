# Introduction 

## What is hardware hackathon

## Purpose

***To foster innovation and hands-on problem-solving among students through a competitive yet educational hardware hackathon. This initiative will challenge participants to creatively solve real-world problems using limited sensors and a tight budget—simulating real constraints in embedded system design.***

# Event Overview

- Organized by : ISTE GCEK
- Title : <input type = textbox >
- Venue : <input type = textbox >
- Tentative Date: <input type="date">
- Team Size : 3-5 Members
- Eligibility : Open To all Engineering Graduates
- Duration : 3-5 Hours

# Problem Statement
Each team must choose one of the following tracks:

1. **ResQTech** – Emergency detection and alert systems (fire, smoke, fall, etc.)

2. **GuardianNode** – Smart Home security systems

3. **HealthBridge** – Affordable health and wellness monitoring

4. **AgroAssist** – Smart farming or resource optimization tools

5. **EcoTrack** – Environmental sensing (pollution, waste, energy usage)

# Hardware Constraints

1. **Sensor Limit**: Each team is allowed to use a **maximum of 5 sensors**. This includes modules like DHT11, MQ2, IR, Ultrasonic, etc.

2. **Budget Limit**: The **total cost of all components used must not exceed ₹1500**.


##### We **do not provide** components. Participants must **bring their own** and should be prepared to **justify costs**.

### **Enforcing The Constraints**

- **Pre-Submission of Component List**: Teams must submit a bill of materials (BOM) with component names, quantity, and cost.

- **Verification**: Budget and sensor limits will be verified by the organizing team using online reference prices (e.g., Robu.in, Amazon, or Maker stores).

- Approved Formate

| Component | Quantity | Price/Unit | Purchasing Link | Total |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
| DHT11     | 1        | 121        | https://robu.in | 121   |
|           |          |            |                 |       |
|           |          |            |                 |       |
| **Total** |          |            |                 | 121   |
